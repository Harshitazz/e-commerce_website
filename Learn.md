# Learn.md - Local Project Build Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to our project! Our project is an ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) site integrated with OpenStreetMap, designed to provide a seamless digital commerce experience for businesses and consumers across Bharat. By leveraging ONDC APIs for data exchange and integrating with OpenStreetMap for location-based services, our platform aims to revolutionize digital commerce accessibility and efficiency.

## Prerequisites
Before you proceed with building the project locally, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:
- **Git**: Version control system for cloning the project repository.
- **Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)**: JavaScript runtime environment and package manager for installing project dependencies.

## Step-by-step Guide
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```
     git clone <repository_link>
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Change your current directory to the cloned project directory:
     ```
     cd <e-commerce_website>
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies by executing:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. **Build the Application:**
   - After installing dependencies, build the application to prepare it for deployment:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```
   - This command compiles and bundles the frontend assets and prepares the project for deployment.

5. **Start the Development Server:**
   - Once the build process is complete, start the development server with the following command:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - This command launches a local server to host the application.

6. **Access the Application:**
   - After the server starts successfully, access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to the provided URL.
   - Explore the various digital commerce services and features offered by the platform.
   - Utilize the integrated OpenStreetMap for location-based services to enhance your user experience.
